<p class="intro">Dear Uncle Struan and Aunty Poppy </p>



<div class="body-text">
<p>I dont know how to start a letter and my grammer skills are terrible so im sorry
 if i butcher the sentiment,I just wanted to say thank from the bottom of my heart for being great friends and
even greater spiritual grandparents. </p>

<p>What you did for me and my family, is something that i will never forget, how you scarificed
  your time, energy and money to pick us up for meeting every Thursday and Sunday and fetching Kayliegh and I for the group, never asking anything in
  return, because of you we were able to get our spiritual food every week and got to spend time in the ministry.</p>

  <p>You are a blessing from Jehovah and I will never be able to repay you back
   for the amount of things that you have done for our family. I just
  want to let you know that you mean alot to me and my family and that I'm fortunate
  to have grandparents like you.   </p>

  <p>I really miss those days when we sat at the table drinking Aunty Poppys delicious hot
    chocolate and just making jokes
    and enjoying each others company, I hope those days can come back again</p>


<p>P.S My goal is to make you cry if you didn't then
  this letter must be deleted if it did then you may keep it. </p>


Yours Truly
